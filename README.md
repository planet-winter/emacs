my emacs config featuring

  * Ansible editing using yaml mode
  * elpy
  * ido-mode
  * per user included settings

  * more

## Setup

clone the repo 

    git clone https://planet-winter@bitbucket.org/planet-winter/emacs.git

and execute

    install.sh

and

    setup.sh


  * this will symlink your .emacs.d to the clone
  * install emacs using yum
  * install elpy python dependencies using pip

the first time you start emacs, it will install some packages
that are best handled by the emacs package manager.
