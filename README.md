# planet-emacs settings

I used https://github.com/magnars/.emacs.d as a starting point


## Setup

clone the repo 

    git clone https://planet-winter@bitbucket.org/planet-winter/emacs.git

and execute

    install.sh

and

    setup.sh

this will symlink your .emacs.d	to the clone

the first time you start emacs, it will install some additional packages
that are best handled by the package manager.
